# LeoECS - Simple lightweight C# Entity Component System framework
Performance, zero/small memory allocations/footprint, no dependencies on any game engine - main goals of this project.

> Tested on unity 2018.3 (not dependent on it) and contains assembly definition for compiling to separate assembly file for performance reason.

> **Important!** Dont forget to use `DEBUG` builds for development and `RELEASE` builds in production: all internal error checks / exception throwing works only in `DEBUG` builds and eleminated for performance reasons in `RELEASE`.

# Main parts of ecs

## Component
Container for user data without / with small logic inside. Can be used any user class without any additional inheritance:
```csharp
class WeaponComponent {
    public int Ammo;
    public string GunName;
}
```

> **Important!** Dont forget to manually init all fields of new added component. Default value initializers will not work due all components can be reused automatically multiple times through builtin pooling mechanism (no destroying / creating new instance for each request for performance reason).

> **Important!** Dont forget to cleanup reference links to instances of another components / engine classes before removing components from entity, otherwise it can lead to memory leaks.
>
> By default all `marshal-by-reference` typed fields of component (classes in common case) will be checked for null on removing attempt in `DEBUG`-mode. If you know that you have object instance that should be not null (preinited collections for example) - `[EcsIgnoreNullCheck]` attribute can be used for disabling these checks.

## Entity
Сontainer for components. Implemented with int id-s for more simplified api:
```csharp
WeaponComponent myWeapon;
int entityId = _world.CreateEntityWith<WeaponComponent> (out myWeapon);
_world.RemoveEntity (entityId);
```
Dont forget that `EcsWorld.CreateEntityWith` method has multiple overloaded versions:
```csharp
Component1 c1;
Component2 c2;
int entityId = _world.CreateEntityWith<Component1, Component2> (out c1, out c2);
_world.RemoveEntity (entityId);
```

> **Important!** Entities without components on them will be automatically removed from `EcsWorld` right after finish execution of current system.

## System
Сontainer for logic for processing filtered entities. User class should implements `IEcsPreInitSystem`, `IEcsInitSystem` or / and `IEcsRunSystem` interfaces:
```csharp
class WeaponSystem : IEcsPreInitSystem, IEcsInitSystem {
    void IEcsPreInitSystem.PreInitialize () {
        // Will be called once during world initialization and before IEcsInitSystem.Initialize.
    }

    void IEcsInitSystem.Initialize () {
        // Will be called once during world initialization.
    }

    void IEcsInitSystem.Destroy () {
        // Will be called once during world destruction.
    }

    void IEcsPreInitSystem.PreDestroy () {
        // Will be called once during world destruction and after IEcsInitSystem.Destroy.
    }
}
```

```csharp
class HealthSystem : IEcsRunSystem {
    void IEcsRunSystem.Run () {
        // Will be called on each EcsSystems.Run() call.
    }
}
```

# Data injection
> **Important!** Will not work when LEOECS_DISABLE_INJECT preprocessor constant defined.

With `[EcsInject]` attribute over `IEcsSystem` class all compatible `EcsWorld` and `EcsFilter<T>` fields of instance of this class will be auto-initialized (auto-injected):
```csharp
[EcsInject]
class HealthSystem : IEcsSystem {
    EcsWorld _world = null;

    EcsFilter<WeaponComponent> _weaponFilter = null;
}
```
Instance of any custom type can be injected to all systems through `EcsSystems.Inject` method:
```csharp
var systems = new EcsSystems (world)
    .Add (new TestSystem1 ())
    .Add (new TestSystem2 ())
    .Add (new TestSystem3 ())
    .Inject (a)
    .Inject (b)
    .Inject (c)
    .Inject (d);
systems.Initialize ();
```
Each system will be scanned for compatible fields (can contains all of them or no one) with proper initialization.

# Special classes

## EcsFilter<T>
Container for keeping filtered entities with specified component list:
```csharp
[EcsInject]
class WeaponSystem : IEcsInitSystem, IEcsRunSystem {
    EcsWorld _world = null;

    // We wants to get entities with "WeaponComponent" and without "HealthComponent".
    EcsFilter<WeaponComponent>.Exclude<HealthComponent> _filter = null;

    void IEcsInitSystem.Initialize () {
        _world.CreateEntityWith<WeaponComponent> ();
    }

    void IEcsInitSystem.Destroy () { }

    void IEcsRunSystem.Run () {
        foreach (var i in _filter) {
            // Components1 array will be automatically filled with instances of type "WeaponComponent".
            var weapon = _filter.Components1[i];
            weapon.Ammo = System.Math.Max (0, weapon.Ammo - 1);
        }
    }
}
```

All compatible entities will be stored at `filter.Entities` array, amount of them - at `filter.EntitiesCount`.

> Important: `filter.Entities`, `filter.Components1`, `filter.Components2`, etc - can't be iterated with foreach-loop directly, use foreach-loop over `filter`, or for-loop with filter.EntitiesCount value as upper-bound.

All components from filter `Include` constraint will be stored at `filter.Components1`, `filter.Components2`, etc - in same order as they were used in filter type declaration.

If autofilling not required (for example, for flag-based components without data), `EcsIgnoreInFilter` attribute can be used for decrease memory usage and increase performance:
```csharp
class Component1 { }

[EcsIgnoreInFilter]
class Component2 { }

[EcsInject]
class TestSystem : IEcsSystem {
    EcsFilter<Component1, Component2> _filter;

    public Test() {
        foreach (var i in _filter) {
            // its valid code.
            var component1 = _filter.Components1[i];

            // its invalid code due to _filter.Components2 is null for memory / performance reasons.
            var component2 = _filter.Components2[i];
        }
    }
}
```

> Important: Any filter supports up to 4 component types as "include" constraints and up to 2 component types as "exclude" constraints. Shorter constraints - better performance.

> Important: If you will try to use 2 filters with same components but in different order - you will get exception with detailed info about conflicted types, but only in `DEBUG` mode. In `RELEASE` mode all checks will be skipped.

## EcsWorld
Root level container for all entities / components, works like isolated environment.
> Important: Do not forget to call `EcsWorld.Dispose` method when instance will not be used anymore.

## EcsSystems
Group of systems to process `EcsWorld` instance:
```csharp
class Startup : MonoBehaviour {
    EcsSystems _systems;

    void OnEnable() {
        // create ecs environment.
        var world = new EcsWorld ();
        _systems = new EcsSystems(world)
            .Add (new WeaponSystem ());
        _systems.Initialize ();
    }
    
    void Update() {
        // process all dependent systems.
        _systems.Run ();
        // optional behaviour for one-frame components.
        _world.RemoveOneFrameComponents ();
    }

    void OnDisable() {
        // destroy systems logical group.
        _systems.Dispose ();
        _systems = null;
        // destroy world.
        _world.Dispose ();
        _world = null;
    }
}
```
> Important: Do not forget to call `EcsSystems.Dispose` method when instance will not be used anymore.

`EcsSystems` instance can be used as nested system (any types of `IEcsPreInitSystem`, `IEcsInitSystem` or `IEcsRunSystem` behaviours are supported):
```csharp
// initialization
var nestedSystems = new EcsSystems (_world)
    .Add (new NestedSystem ());
// dont call nestedSystems.Initialize() here, rootSystems will do it automatically.

var rootSystems = new EcsSystems (_world)
    .Add (nestedSystems);
rootSystems.Initialize();

// update loop
// dont call nestedSystems.Run() here, rootSystems will do it automatically.
rootSystems.Run();

// destroying
// dont call nestedSystems.Dispose() here, rootSystems will do it automatically.
rootSystems.Dispose();
```

# Sharing data between systems
If some data should be shared between systems - there are 3 ways to do it.
## Custom `EcsWorld` class
Useful for global singleton-like access to independent systems:
```csharp
class MyEcsWorld : EcsWorld {
    readonly public MyData Data;

    public MyEcsWorld(MyData data) {
        Data = data;
    }
}
var shared = new MyData();
// fill it here.
// ...
var world = new MyEcsWorld (shared);
var systems = new EcsSystems (world)
    .Add (new System1 ())
    .Add (new System2 ());
systems.Initialize();
```
## Component with `EcsFilter`
Custom component can be used for this and sharing with `EcsFilter`:
```csharp
class MyData {
    // shared data.
}
[EcsInject]
class CreateSharedData : IEcsInitSystem {
    // just to be sure that filter already created before component initialization.
    EcsFilter<MyData> _shared = null;
    EcsWorld _world = null;

    void IEcsInitSystem.Initialize () {
        var data = _world.CreateEntityWith<MyData>();
        // fill data here.
    }

    void IEcsInitSystem.Destroy () { }
}

[EcsInject]
class ReadSharedData : IEcsRunSystem {
    EcsFilter<MyData> _shared = null;

    void IEcsRunSystem.Run () {
        var data = _shared.Components1[0];
        // read data here.
    }
}
```
## Dependency Injection
> **Important!** Will not work when LEOECS_DISABLE_INJECT preprocessor constant defined.

External data can be shared for all systems at `EcsSystems`:
```csharp
class MyData {
    // shared data.
}
[EcsInject]
class ReadSharedData1 : IEcsRunSystem {
    // will be automatically injected.
    MyData _shared = null;

    void IEcsRunSystem.Run () {
        // read _shared fields here.
    }
}
[EcsInject]
class ReadSharedData2 : IEcsRunSystem {
    // will be automatically injected.
    MyData _shared = null;

    void IEcsRunSystem.Run () {
        // read _shared fields here.
    }
}
//...
var shared = new MyData();
// fill it here.

var systems = new EcsSystems (world)
    .Add (new ReadSharedData1 ())
    .Add (new ReadSharedData2 ())
    .Inject (shared);
systems.Initialize ();
```

# FAQ

### My project complex enough, I need more than 256 components. How I can do it?

There are no components limit, but for performance / memory usage reason better to keep amount of components on each entity less or equals 8.

### I want to create alot of new entities with new components on start, how to speed up this process?

In this case custom component creator with predefined capacity can be used (for speed up 2x or more):

```csharp
class MyComponent { }

class Startup : Monobehaviour {
    EcsSystems _systems;

    void OnEnable() {
        var world = new MyWorld (_sharedData);
        
        EcsComponentPool<MyComponent>.Instance.SetCapacity (100000);
        EcsComponentPool<MyComponent>.Instance.SetCreator (() => new MyComponent());
        
        _systems = new EcsSystems(world)
            .Add (MySystem());
        _systems.Initialize();
    }
}
```

### I want to shrink allocated caches for my components, how I can do it?

In this case `EcsComponentPool<T>.Instance.Shrink` method can be used:

```csharp
class MyComponent1 { }
class MyComponent2 { }

class ShrinkComponents : Monobehaviour {
    void OnEnable() {
        EcsComponentPool<MyComponent1>.Instance.Shrink ();
        EcsComponentPool<MyComponent2>.Instance.Shrink ();
    }
}
```

### I want to process one system at MonoBehaviour.Update() and another - at MonoBehaviour.FixedUpdate(). How I can do it?

For splitting systems by `MonoBehaviour`-method multiple `EcsSystems` logical groups should be used:
```csharp
EcsSystems _update;
EcsSystems _fixedUpdate;

void OnEnable() {
    var world = new EcsWorld();
    _update = new EcsSystems(world).Add(new UpdateSystem());
    _fixedUpdate = new EcsSystems(world).Add(new FixedUpdateSystem());
}

void Update() {
    _update.Run();
}

void FixedUpdate() {
    _fixedUpdate.Run();
}
```

### I want to add reaction on add / remove entity / components in `EcsWorld`. How I can do it?

It will add performance penalty and should be avoided. Anyway, **LEOECS_ENABLE_WORLD_EVENTS** preprocessor define can be used for this:
```csharp
class MyListener : IEcsWorldEventListener {
    public void OnEntityCreated (int entity) { }
    public void OnEntityRemoved (int entity) { }
    public void OnComponentAdded (int entity, object component) { }
    public void OnComponentRemoved (int entity, object component) { }
    public void OnWorldDestroyed (EcsWorld world) { }
}

// at init code.
var listener = new MyListener();
_world.AddEventListener(listener);

// at destroy code.
_world.RemoveEventListener(listener);
```

### I do not need dependency injection through `Reflection` (I heard, it's very slooooow! / I want to use my own way to inject). How I can do it?

Builtin Reflection-based DI can be removed with **LEOECS_DISABLE_INJECT** preprocessor define:
* No `EcsInject` attribute.
* No automatic injection for `EcsWorld` and `EcsFilter<T>` fields.
* Less code size.

`EcsWorld` should be injected somehow (for example, through constructor of system), `EcsFilter<T>` data can be requested through `EcsWorld.GetFilter<T>` method.

### I do not like foreach-loops, I know that for-loops are faster. How I can use it?

Current implementation of foreach-loop fast enough (custom enumerator, no memory allocation), performance differences can be found on 10k items and more. Anyway, for-loop can be used instead foreach-loop as next in-place replacement without issues:
```csharp
foreach (var i in _filter)
```
can be replaced with
```csharp
for (int i = 0, iMax = _filter.EntitiesCount; i < iMax; i++)
```

### I copy&paste my reset components code again and again. How I can do it in other manner?

If you want to simplify your code and keep reset-code in one place, you can use `IEcsAutoResetComponent` interface for components:
```csharp
class MyComponent : IEcsAutoResetComponent {
    public object LinkToAnotherComponent;

    void IEcsAutoResetComponent.Reset() {
        // Cleanup all marshal-by-reference fields here.
        LinkToAnotherComponent = null;
    }
}
```
This method will be automatically called after component removing from entity and before recycling to component pool.

### I use components as events that works only one frame, then remove it at last system in execution sequence. It's boring, how I can automate it?

If you want to remove one-frame components without additional custom code, you can use `EcsOneFrame` attribute:
```csharp
[EcsOneFrame]
class MyComponent { }
```
> Important: Do not forget to call `EcsWorld.RemoveOneFrameComponents` method once after all `EcsSystems.Run` calls.

> Important: Do not forget that if one-frame component contains `marshal-by-reference` typed fields - this component should implements `IEcsAutoResetComponent` interface.

### I used reactive systems and filter events before, but now I can't find them. How I can get it back?

You can implement them by yourself with `EcsFilter.AddListener` / `EcsFilter.RemoveListener` methods or use default implementation, that can be found at [separate repo](https://github.com/Leopotam/ecs-reactive).

### I need more than 4 components in filter, how i can do it?

Check `EcsFilter<Inc1, Inc2, Inc3, Inc4>` class and create new class with more components in same manner.
