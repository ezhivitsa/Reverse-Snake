# LeoECS - Another one Entity Component System framework
Performance and zero memory allocation / small size, no dependencies on any game engine - main goals of this project.

> Tested on unity 2018.1 (not dependent on it) and contains assembly definition for compiling to separate assembly file for performance reason.

# Main parts of ecs

## Component
Container for user data without / with small logic inside. Can be used any user class without any additional inheritance:
```
class WeaponComponent {
    public int Ammo;
    public string GunName;
}
```

## Entity
Сontainer for components. Implemented with int id-s for more simplified api:
```
int entity = _world.CreateEntity ();
_world.RemoveEntity (entity);
```

## System
Сontainer for logic for processing filtered entities. User class should implements `IEcsPreInitSystem`, `IEcsInitSystem` or `IEcsRunSystem` interfaces:
```
class WeaponSystem : IEcsPreInitSystem, IEcsInitSystem {
    void IEcsPreInitSystem.PreInitialize () {
        // Will be called once during world initialization before IEcsInitSystem.OnInitialize().
    }

    void IEcsInitSystem.OnInitialize () {
        // Will be called once during world initialization.
    }

    void IEcsPreInitSystem.PreDestroy () {
        // Will be called once during world destruction before IEcsInitSystem.OnDestroy().
    }

    void IEcsInitSystem.OnDestroy () {
        // Will be called once during world destruction.
    }
}
```

```
class HealthSystem : IEcsRunSystem {
    void IEcsRunSystem.Run () {
        // Will be called on each EcsSystems.Run() call.
    }
}
```

# Data injection
> **Will not work with LEOECS_DISABLE_INJECT preprocessor define.**

With `[EcsInject]` attribute over `IEcsSystem` class all compatible `EcsWorld` and `EcsFilter<>` fields of instance of this class will be auto-initialized (auto-injected):
```
[EcsInject]
class HealthSystem : IEcsSystem {
    EcsWorld _world = null;

    EcsFilter<WeaponComponent> _weaponFilter = null;
}
```

# Special classes

## EcsFilter<>
Container for keep filtered entities with specified component list:
```
[EcsInject]
class WeaponSystem : IEcsInitSystem, IEcsRunSystem {
    EcsWorld _world = null;

    // We wants to get entities with "WeaponComponent" and without "HealthComponent".
    EcsFilter<WeaponComponent>.Exclude<HealthComponent> _filter = null;

    void IEcsInitSystem.OnInitialize () {
        _world.CreateEntityWith<WeaponComponent> ();
    }

    void IEcsInitSystem.OnDestroy () { }

    void IEcsRunSystem.Run () {
        // Important: foreach-loop cant be used for filtered entities!
        for (var i = 0; i < _filter.EntitiesCount; i++) {
            // Components1 array fill be automatically filled with instances of type "WeaponComponent".
            var weapon = _filter.Components1[i];
            weapon.Ammo = System.Math.Max (0, weapon.Ammo - 1);
        }
    }
}
```

All compatible entities will be stored at `filter.Entities` array, amount of them - at `filter.EntitiesCount`.

> Important: `filter.Entities` cant be iterated with foreach-loop, for-loop should be used instead with filter.EntitiesCount value as upper-bound.

All components from filter `Include`-ruleset will be stored at `filter.Components1`, `filter.Components2`, etc - in same order as they were used in filter type declaration.

> Important: Any filter supports up to 5 component types as "include" ruleset and up to 2 component types as "exclude" ruleset. Shorter rulesets - better performance.

> Important: If you will try to use 2 filters with same components but in different order - you will get exception with detailed info about conflicted types, but only in `DEBUG` mode. In `RELEASE` mode all checks will be skipped.

## EcsWorld
Root level container for all entities / components, works like isolated environment.

## EcsSystems
Group of systems to process `EcsWorld` instance:
```
class Startup : MonoBehaviour {
    EcsSystems _systems;

    void OnEnable() {
        // create ecs environment.
        var world = new EcsWorld ();
        _systems = new EcsSystems(world)
            .Add (new WeaponSystem ());
        _systems.Initialize ();
    }
    
    void Update() {
        // process all dependent systems.
        _systems.Run ();
    }

    void OnDisable() {
        // destroy systems logical group.
        _systems.OnDestroy ();
    }
}
```

# Sharing data between systems
If `EcsWorld` class should contains some shared fields (useful for sharing assets / prefabs), it can be implemented in this way:
```
class MySharedData : ScriptableObject {
    public string PlayerName = "Unknown";
    public GameObject PlayerModel;
}

class MyWorld: EcsWorld {
    public readonly MySharedData Assets;

    public MyWorld(MySharedData data) {
        Assets = data;
    }
}

[EcsInject]
class ChangePlayerName : IEcsInitSystem {
    MyWorld _world = null;

    // This field will be initialized with same reference as _world field.
    EcsWorld _standardWorld = null;

    void IEcsInitSystem.OnInitialize () {
        _world.Assets.PlayerName = "Jack";
    }

    void IEcsInitSystem.OnDestroy () { }
}
[EcsInject]
class SpawnPlayerModel : IEcsInitSystem {
    MyWorld _world = null;

    void IEcsInitSystem.OnInitialize () {
        GameObject.Instantiate(_world.Assets.PlayerModel);
    }

    void IEcsInitSystem.OnDestroy () { }
}

class Startup : Monobehaviour {
    [SerializedField]
    MySharedData _sharedData;

    EcsSystems _systems;

    void OnEnable() {
        var world = new MyWorld (_sharedData);
        _systems = new EcsSystems(world)
            .Add (ChangePlayerName())
            .Add (SpawnPlayerModel());
        _systems.Initialize();
    }
}
```

# FAQ

### My project complex enough, I need more than 256 components. How I can do it?

There are no components limit, but for performance / memory usage reason better to keep amount of components on each entity less or equals 8.

### I want to create alot of new entities with new components on start, how to speed up this process?

In this case custom component creator can be used (for speed up 2x or more):

```
class MyComponent { }

class Startup : Monobehaviour {
    EcsSystems _systems;

    void OnEnable() {
        var world = new MyWorld (_sharedData);
        
        EcsWorld.RegisterComponentCreator<MyComponent> (() => new MyComponent());
        
        _systems = new EcsSystems(world)
            .Add (MySystem());
        _systems.Initialize();
    }
}
```

### I want to process one system at MonoBehaviour.Update() and another - at MonoBehaviour.FixedUpdate(). How I can do it?

For splitting systems by `MonoBehaviour`-method multiple `EcsSystems` logical groups should be used:
```
EcsSystems _update;
EcsSystems _fixedUpdate;

void OnEnable() {
    var world = new EcsWorld();
    _update = new EcsSystems(world).Add(new UpdateSystem());
    _fixedUpdate = new EcsSystems(world).Add(new FixedUpdateSystem());
}

void Update() {
    _update.Run();
}

void FixedUpdate() {
    _fixedUpdate.Run();
}
```

### I dont need dependency injection (I heard, it's very slooooow! / I want to use my own way to inject). How I can do it?

Builtin DI can be removed with **LEOECS_DISABLE_INJECT** preprocessor define:
* No `EcsInject` attribute.
* No automatic injection for `EcsWorld` and `EcsFilter<>` fields.
* Less code size.

### I used reactive systems and filter events before, but now I can't find them. How I can get it back?

Reactive events support was removed for performance reason and for more clear execution flow of components processing by systems:
* Less internal magic.
* Less code size.
* Small performance gain.
* Less memory usage.

If you really need them - better to stay on ["v20180422 release"](https://github.com/Leopotam/ecs/releases/tag/v20180422).

### How it fast relative to Entitas?

[Previous version](https://github.com/Leopotam/ecs/releases/tag/v20180422) was benchmarked at [this repo](https://github.com/echeg/unityecs_speedtest). Current version works in slightly different manner, better to grab last versions of ECS frameworks and check boths locally on your code.
